# Volatility Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the volatility of stock prices using machine learning techniques.

## Project Structure

- **data**: Contains raw and processed data.
- **notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model building.
- **src**: Source code for the model, including feature engineering and training scripts.
- **tests**: Unit tests for the codebase.
- **configs**: Configuration files for model parameters and settings.
- **artifacts**: Outputs like model files, reports, and other generated resources.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nitij-taneja/Volatility_Prediction
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Volatility_Prediction
    ```

3. Set up a Python virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:
    - For Windows:
      ```bash
      .\venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - For MacOS/Linux:
      ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

5. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

6. Once the dependencies are installed, you're ready to run the project.

## Usage

To use the model and start making predictions, follow these steps:

1. Run the notebook or Python script for data exploration and model training.
2. After the model is trained, use the saved model to make predictions on new data.

Example usage (from the notebook):
```bash
from src.model import predict_volatility

# Example prediction
predicted_volatility = predict_volatility(input_data)
print(predicted_volatility)
```
